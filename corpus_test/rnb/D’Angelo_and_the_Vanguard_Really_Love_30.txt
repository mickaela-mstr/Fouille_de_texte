¿Me amas? ¿Sí? ¿Me amas?
Yo te quiero mucho
Todo el tiempo que pasamos
Lo que te quería decir es que tú está' jodiéndome la vida
Yo no quería pelear contigo, yo solamente te quería amar
Pero tú era' muy celoso, querías ser mi dueño
Pero yo soy libre
¿Quieres ser mi rey y yo tu reina?
No sé si confío en ti
Pero yo te quiero mucho

[Verse 1: D'Angelo]
When you call my name
When you love me gently
When you're walking near me
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
When you look at me, oh, my Lord
I open up instantly
I fall in love so quickly
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you


[Bridge: D'Angelo]
All night beside you I'd lay
I love you deep when you come to my bed
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
Wah, I'm in really love with you, huh
I'm in really love with you

[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
When you touch me there (Touch me there)
When you make me tingle
When our nectars mingle
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love
I'm not an easy man, no, to overstand, you feel me?
But girl, you're patient with me
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you, yeah, yeah
I'm in really love with you

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
All night I wish for you here
Lay your head beside of my hip
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Love me, baby

[Outro: D'Angelo]
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Doo doo, wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you, ooh
Yeah, yeah, I'm in really love with you
Oh, how I love the little things you do
I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you, yeah
I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
