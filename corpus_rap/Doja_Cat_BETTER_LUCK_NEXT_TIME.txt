The beach is a good place to pick up girls
Because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are— of chicks
And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
Huh, hmm, hmm

I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, "Mother never weep," my brother finds blood
I say, "Shut up ’fore she sees," another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters"
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
Better luck next time

Bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time

Bet—, bet—
Bet—, bet—
Bet—, bet—
Bet—
