What it is, ho? What's up?
Every good girl needs a little thug
Every block boy needs a little love
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up

Can't you see it's just me and you?
Panoramic view, that's my point of view, bae
All about me, that's the energy
That's that lemon pepper thing, I'm a ten-piece, baby

Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (Love)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (Ayy), up (Ayy)
What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (Love)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (Ayy), up (Ayy)

Hit 'еm up, hit 'em up
In the truck, got it tucked
Hе get it up, like it's stuck
All night, I like
You ain't gotta say it when you know it's on-site

Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (Love)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (Ayy), up (Ayy)
What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (Love)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (Ayy), up (Ayy)

I don't care if you run the streets
Long as you're comin' home to me
I love the way you walk and the way you speak
He gon' keep it real, that's the deal
That's the reason that I speed down, down (Down, down, down)
I put that all on my name (All on my name)
Yeah, that's an even exchange (Tell me what it is)
Stay on your deal, we gon' tell 'em, we gon' tell 'em what, babe

What it is, ho? What's up? (What it is?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Needs a little thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (Needs a little love, yeah)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up
What it is, ho? What's up? (Oh, what's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (Needs a little love)
Every block boy needs a little love (Needs a little love, thug)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (Ayy, ayy)

Back it up and do, do it like that, yeah (What it is? What's up?)
Back it up and do it like that, yeah (Ho)
Back it up, back it and do it like that, yeah
Back it up, don't do it like that, yeah (Woo)
Hey, what it is? Hey, what's up?
J. White Did It (Yup, yup)
More hits on the way (Yup, yup), yeah
We need a lil' love, you know what I mean? (Yeah, ayy-ayy, woo)
Ride out, woah
