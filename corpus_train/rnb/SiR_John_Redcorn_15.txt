Alone, every night alone
Why am I alone when I know that you want me too?
Am I wrong? Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me I deserve all the pain that you put me through, oh

[Verse 1]
I really hate that I give a fuck
Pressin' my line, I don't wanna pick up
We know enough won't ever be enough
I play hard to get, she keep callin' my bluff
Baby divin' deeper and deeper
She don't believe me when I tell her that I need her
Guess I shoulda stayed where I belong
'Cause once you make it back to your happy home...

[Chorus]
I'm alone, every night alone
Why am I alone when I know that you want me too?
Am I wrong? Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me I deserve all the pain that you put me through, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You don't ever bring me good news, babe
I just wanna be the one you choose, babe


[Verse 2]
Dream girl got me losin' sleep
Baby, you remind me of my Jeep
Maybe I'd be better on the run
Double vision playin' all week
This feels like a game of survival
Why am I dyin' for a title?
Is it even worth the fight?

[Chorus]
When I just end up alone, every night alone
Why am I alone when I know that you want me too?
Am I wrong? Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me I deserve all the pain that you put me through, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You don't ever bring me good news, babe
I just wanna be the one you choose, babe
You don't ever bring me good news, babe
I just wanna be the one you choose, babe

[Outro]
Dream girl got me losin' sleep
Baby, you remind me of my Jeep
Maybe I'd be better on the run
Double vision playin' all week
