9 ContributorsSAY SO Lyrics[Intro: PJ Morton, JoJo & Both]
Ooh, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Oh, oh-woah-oh

[Verse 1: PJ Morton & JoJo]
It's getting hard for me to hold my own
See, nobody wants to be in love alone
So I'm trying my best not to overreact
But I need to know right now, no lies, just facts

[Chorus: PJ Morton & JoJo]
So if you love me, just say so
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more
So if you love me, just say so
I need to know from you right now before I go

[Verse 2: JoJo]
It's just that I can feel I'm falling deep
And I don't wanna fall unless you're falling with me
I need to know if this is really real
And if you feel the same way that I feel

[Chorus: PJ Morton & JoJo, PJ Morton & JoJo]
So if you love me, just say so,  just say so
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more (Oh)
So if you love me, just say so, then just say so
I need to know from you right now before I go


[Post-Chorus: PJ Morton & JoJo]
Just say, "La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"

[Bridge: PJ Morton & JoJo]
Baby, I hope that you understand
This is for my peace of mind
And I just don't wanna waste any more time
And if this love isn't what you want
Then baby, let me know
I don't wanna go but I'll walk out that door, oh, woah

[Chorus: PJ Morton & JoJo, PJ Morton & JoJo]
So if you love me, just say so, can you just say so?
'Cause I can't play these games with you no more, oh-woah
If you love me, just say so, then just say so
I need to know from you right now before I go
