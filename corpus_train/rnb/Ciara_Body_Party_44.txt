Oh, oh, oh, oh (EarDrummers)
Yeah, right there (Mike WiLL Made-It)
No, right there
I'm just having fun
I hope you're having fun too
Listen to this

[Verse 1]
My body is your party, baby
Nobody's invited but you, baby
I can do it slow, now
Tell me what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, put your phone down
You should turn it off (Turn it off)
'Cause tonight it's going down (Down)
Tell your boys it's going down (Down)
We in the zone now (Now), don't stop (Don't stop)
Oh-ooh

[Chorus]
You can't keep your hands off me (Hands off me)
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you (Hands off you)
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you (You, you, you, you)
You got me so excited
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh


[Post-Chorus]
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it
I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you

[Verse 2]
I can't lie, I won't lie, It's amazing (So amazing)
My faces, the places you're taking me (Take me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, take your time now
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)
We can go another round
If that's what you want (What, what you want)
'Cause tonight it's going down (Down)
Yeah, you know it's going down (Down, down)
We in the zone now (Now), don't stop
(Ooh-oh)

[Chorus]
You can't keep your hands off me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh


[Post-Chorus]
Boy, you should know that (Boy, it's your love)
Your love is always on my mind (Mind)
I'm not gonna fight it (I'm not gon' fight it)
I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you

[Outro]
The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started
Oh
