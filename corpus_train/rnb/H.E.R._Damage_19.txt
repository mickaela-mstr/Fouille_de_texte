43 ContributorsDamage Lyrics[Verse 1: H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
If you got it, it ain't no question
No, it ain't no room for guessin'
No more than emotionally invested (No, no)
Showin' you all my imperfections, oh

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R., Ant Clemons, H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
If I let you, don't take me for granted, yeah (You, you, you, you)
If I'm worth more than you could manage, manage, yeah
Open with me, oh, we could be honest
Closer to me, oh, givin' me solace
Promise that you won't let me fall, oh, oh

[Chorus: H.E.R., Ant Clemons, H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
Holdin' me tight, lovin' me right, givin' me life
All night you could be (You could be)
Tellin' me lies, makin' me cry, wastin' my time
The whole timе, so just be
Careful what you take for grantеd, yeah
'Cause with me know you could do damage
You (Uh), you could do damage
You (You), you could do damage (You, you, you, you)
Yeah, uh

[Verse 2: H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
Worry 'bout it, I'm puttin' pressure (You know)
You'll only cut me if I let you
No, we ain't doing this just for pleasure
Either learn me or I'm a lesson, gone, no


[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R., H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
If you want me don't take me for granted, yeah, yeah
If I'm worth more than you could manage, baby
Oh, you're fallin' for me, oh, baby, I've caught it
Ooh, we could be whatever you wanna call it
Promise that you won't let me fall, oh, oh

[Chorus:  H.E.R., H.E.R. & Ant Clemons]
Holdin' me tight, lovin' me right, givin' me life
All night, you could be (You could be)
Tellin' me lies, makin' me cry, wastin' my time
The whole time, so just be
Careful what you take for granted, yeah
'Cause with me know you could do damage
You (Uh), you could do damage
You, you could do damage

[Outro: H.E.R.]
Oh, you could do damage
Oh, you could do damage, yeah
Oh, you could damage, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Oh, you could damage, on me
