I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

[Verse 2]
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

[Verse 3]
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

[Refrain]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
[Chorus]
Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes, I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes, I don't wanna feel those metal clouds


[Verse 4]
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head'd be feeling clearer
I traveled seventy states
Thought moving 'round'd make me feel better

[Verse 5]
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover

Away

[Refrain]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
[Chorus]
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes, I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes, I don't wanna feel those metal—

[Refrain]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
