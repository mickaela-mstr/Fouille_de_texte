We don't know what we’re made of
The same thing we're afraid of might improve us
Stay up all night, just lay up
Use half of this pay stub to make moves with
Or all of it, of course

[Pre-Chorus]
And it ain't no room in Paris
We could still fly high, then crash here
Just make sure you pass it
No, you can’t imagine
Ooh, it's automatic
The life we live is lavish

[Chorus]
We don't have to be here if we stay
We don't have to leave if we go
Roll some mo'
And we ain't too high if we see eye to eye
Know you feel the rush from a simple touch
Baby, roll some mo'

[Verse 2]
Through some kissin', lifted up through your vision
Got me on my knees, you’re my religion
Speak in tongues all on your body, no one’s listenin'
Tap out on you, that’s a submission, know you give in
Can't let no time go wasted
This moment can't replace it
Sittin' around so lazy
Comfortably, we’ll fade away


[Pre-Chorus]
And it ain't no room in Paris
We could still fly high, then crash here
Just make sure you pass it
No, you can't imagine
Ooh, it's automatic
The life we live is lavish

[Chorus]
We don't have to be here if we stay
We don't have to leave if we go
Roll some mo'
And we ain't too high if we see eye to eye
Know you feel the rush from a simple touch
Baby, roll some mo'
