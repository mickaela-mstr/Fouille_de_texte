35 ContributorsWhipped Cream Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
I've been eatin' whipped cream, havin' vivid dreams
Of your face and through people on TV screens
You've been everywhere
And I wish I didn't care
Oh, you've been everywhere
I wish, wish I didn't care, yeah, mmm
Wish I didn't

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' of you, I've been keepin' you
Alignin' my soul with the devil that it chose
I've been thinkin' this, thinkin' of some kids
How I'm agin', degradin' when I give it like this
I've been cryin' at night, holdin' bullet tight
Hopin' I meet someone different, but it's true that I don't

[Chorus]
I've been eatin' whipped cream, havin' vivid dreams
Of your face and through people on the TV screen
Everywhere (Said I'll be, yeah)
Said I wish I didn't care (Oh, and you)
Oh, you've been everywhere
I wish, wish I didn't care


[Verse 2]
I've been in my feels, I've been stackin' bills
Online shoppin' and robbin' my chance of survivin'
I'm late on rent, what was I thinkin'?
I'm gon' go to the gym, squat real low for a man
'Round you it revolves, I can't shake it off
Unrequited, admit it, you were never mine at all
Never mine, never mine
Never mine at all (No, at all)
Ayy, yeah, never mine
Never mine at all

[Chorus]
I've been eatin' whipped cream, havin' vivid dreams
Of your face and through people on TV screens
You've been everywhere
And I wish I didn't care
Oh, you've been everywhere (Ayy, yeah)
Ooh, I wish (Said I wish)
Wish I didn't care

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, ooh (TV screens)
Eat
Ooh, yeah, ooh (Mmm, TV screens)
Your deceivin', receivin', non-givin' headass (Ayy, ayy)
Your deceivin', receivin', non-givin' headass (Oh yeah, yeah, hey)


[Chorus]
I've been eatin' whipped cream, havin' vivid dreams (I do)
Of your face and through people on TV screens
You've been everywhere
And I wish I didn't care (Ayy)
Oh, you've been everywhere (You've been, you've been, you've been)
I wish (Hey, yeah)
Wish I didn't care (Yeah, yeah)
