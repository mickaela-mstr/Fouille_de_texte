I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you

[Pre-Chorus]
We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

[Chorus]
You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there

I can count on you like four, three, two and you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me

You know you can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two and you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
