I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new, hoo

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fadin' fast
Been savin' it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold


[Chorus]
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

[Bridge]
Woah
Woah (Ah)
Woah

[Verse 3]
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothin' to hide

[Chorus]
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

[Outro]
Like a virgin
Ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Yeah, can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?
