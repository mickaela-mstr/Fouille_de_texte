I know you're not
The sharpest tool in the shed
We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget
I don't hear a word
'Til your guilt creeps in
On a Tuesday, send a soft "hey"
As if you really don't recall the time

[Pre-Chorus]
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we'rе fine
You're confused and I'm upsеt, but

[Chorus]
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
We never talk about it

[Bridge]
All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me


[Refrain]
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset, but

[Chorus]
We never talk about it (We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it)
We never talk about it (We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it)
We never talk about it (We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it)
(We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it)

[Refrain]
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh


[Outro]
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it (We never talk about it)
We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it (We never talk about it)
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it (We never talk about it)
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it
