Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day


[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Interlude]
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world

[Verse 3]
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl


[Outro]
A material, a material, a material, a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material-al)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material-al)
Living in a material world
