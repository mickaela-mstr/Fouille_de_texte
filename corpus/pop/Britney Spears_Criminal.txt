He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh
Should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart


[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Bridge]
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay
He's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy (I love the guy)
(Oh-oh, I know, oh) Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go, but no) And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
(Oh-oh, I know, oh) Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go, but no) All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
