The song focuses on a girl that Ed spoke to “when [he] did a gig at a homeless shelter.”… Read More [Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly


[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


[Bridge]
An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"

[Post-Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


[Outro]
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die
