I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

[Chorus]
Talkin' to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talkin' to the moon?
Oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talkin' back, yeah, they're talkin' back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself


[Chorus]
Talkin' to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Do you ever hear me callin'?
Oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh), oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I'm talkin' to the moon
Still tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talkin' to the moon?
Oh

[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
