Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown


[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown


[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Breakdown]
Ew

[Verse 3]
In the most Biblical sense (Ew)
I am beyond repentance
Fame, hooker, prostitute, wench
Vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offenced
Or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to


[Chorus]
Just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh)
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-as)
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-as)

[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
