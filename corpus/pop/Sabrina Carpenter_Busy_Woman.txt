(Oh, hey)
Oh

[Verse 1]
I'm so mature, collected and sensible
Except when I get hit with rejection
To turn me down, well, that's just unethical
I'll turn into someone you're scared to know

[Chorus]
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place
And if you don't need (If you don't need) my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies (Oh, hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Busy woman, all the time
Busy woman

[Verse 2]
So much to shave and lipstick to reapply
Maybe for you, though, I could accommodate
I'm flexible, so just tell me what you like
Tantric yoga, baby, namaste
If you don't want me, I'll just deem you gay


[Chorus]
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place (Ah)
And if you don't need (If you don't need) my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies

[Bridge]
Busy woman, all the time
Busy woman for the rest of my life
My openings are super tight
Busy woman, unless you call tonight
Night (Ooh)
Ooh

[Chorus]
But if you need my love
My clothes are off, I'm comin' over to your place (Ah)
And if you don't need (If you don't need) my love (My love)
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
'Cause I'm a busy woman (Oh, hey)
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs. 'til the day that one of us dies
