Ain't nothin' wrong with it

[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression (No, no, no, no)
I need love and affection (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I hope I'm not soundin' too desperate
I need love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Oh, baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and, when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
And let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
(I-I-I) Won't play around
(I-I-I) I wanna lay you down
(I-I-I) I need you now, I need you now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh


[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression (No, no, no, no)
I need love and affection (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wonderin, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want, so come express it
Don't slip, don't slip, 'cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now, I want you now
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression (No, no, no, no)
I need love and affection (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Love and affection
Love (Oh, oh, oh, oh), love (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
L-O-V-E-E-E and affection


[Bridge: Future, Future & Rihanna, Rihanna]
Can you love me for poor? (Let me know)
I'm searching for my soul (Rockstar)
Who ever turned you cold? (Because)
You need to let him know (Yeah, yeah)
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical (Physical) (Turned up)
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart beating through my clothes, ooh, oh
Future

[Chorus: Rihanna & Future, Future, Rihanna]
