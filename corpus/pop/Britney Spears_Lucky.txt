This is a story about a girl named Lucky

[Verse 1]
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 2]
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say


[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Interlude: Max Martin]
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

[Bridge]
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
