I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one

[Post-Chorus]
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 2]
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one

[Bridge]
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?


[Chorus]
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one

[Outro]
I could be the one
