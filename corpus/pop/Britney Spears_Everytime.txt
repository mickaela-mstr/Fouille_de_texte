Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I done?

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
