And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 1]
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

[Pre-Chorus]

At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 2]
Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Yeah


[Bridge]
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
You've got to

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Bridge]
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
You've got to
