Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra

[Verse 1]
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around

[Refrain]
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

[Chorus]
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"


[Drop]
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on firе
Abracadabra, abracadabra

[Verse 2]
Choose the road on the wеst side
As the dust flies, watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feeling
Use your passion, no return

[Refrain]
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

[Chorus]
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"


[Drop]
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra

[Bridge]
Phantom of the dance floor, come to me
Sing for me a sinful melody
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"
