Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso

[Verse 1]

My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso


[Post-Chorus]
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Mm)

[Verse 2]
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen

[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (Ayy, ayy, oh)
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Stupid)

[Chorus]
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Move it up, down, left, right, oh (Move it up, down, left, right, oh)
Switch it up like Nintendo (Yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso


[Outro]
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Mm, that's that me espresso
