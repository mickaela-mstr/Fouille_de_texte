Guess I'll end this life alone
I am not dramatic
These are just the thoughts that pass right through me
All the douchebags in my phone
Play 'em like a slot machine
If they're winnin', I'm just losin'

[Pre-Chorus]
A boy who's jacked and kind
Can't find his ass to save my life

[Chorus]
Oh, it's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Jesus, what's a girl to do?
This boy doesn't even know
The difference between "there," "their" and "they are"
Yet he's naked in my room
Missin' all the things he's missin'
God knows that he isn't livin' large


[Pre-Chorus]
A boy who's nice that breathes
I swear he's nowhere to be seen

[Chorus]
It's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'

[Post-Chorus]
Moanin' and bitchin'

[Outro]
Since the good ones call their exes wasted
And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Then I'll just be here in the kitchen
Servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'
