I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving till late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside (Hey)

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)


[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside (Hey)

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah


[Breakdown]
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah (Hey)
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind (Hey)

[Bridge]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside
Hey
Mwah

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
