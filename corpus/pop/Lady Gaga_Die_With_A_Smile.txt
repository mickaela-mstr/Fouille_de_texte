(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)


[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Bridge: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Both]
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh


[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Outro: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to you
