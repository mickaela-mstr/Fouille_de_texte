Yo, B, they ready
Let's go

Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks
My Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off
'Cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinkin' 'bout me when he whacks off
Wax on? Wax off
Na-na-national anthem, hats off
Then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Let me get a number two with some Mac sauce
"On The Run Tour" with my mask off

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you was when that digital popped
I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world
World, stop
Carry on

Kitty on fleek (Ooh), pretty on fleek (Uh)
Pre-pre-pretty gang always keep them niggas on geek (Ooh)
Ridin'-ridin' through Texas (Texas), feed him for his breakfast (Breakfast)
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said, "Damn, Nicki, it's tight," I-I say, "Yeah, nigga, you right"
He said, "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I said, "Yes, daddy, I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said, "Teach me, nigga, teach me, all this learnin' here is by you" (Uh)

I'm whippin' that work, he diggin' that work
I got it, thirty-six of that real
Panky full of that bounce, baby
Come get you some of that bounce, baby

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm killin' my

Smoke it all off, talkin' bout that high-grade (High-grade)

Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow (He in love)
I have both and an empire also (In love)
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole (In love)
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho, ho, let-let-let that ho know (He in love)
He in love with that coco
Why-why-why-why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on Top 40
I am a rap legend, just go ask the Kings of Rap
Who is the Queen and things of that nature?
Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser (Rrr)
Drippin' on that work, trip-trippin' off that Perc'
Flip-flip-flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's (Ki's), car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen B and we be whippin' all of that D
'Cause we dope girls, we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow

Rrr
