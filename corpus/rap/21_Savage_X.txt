Ten bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard, then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage, bitch, but no, I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a Plan B
And I'm sippin' on that codeine, not Brandy (21)

Hah, hah, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hold up)
I was just flexin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up, hah, hah, ha)
Hold up, I was just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up, hold up, hold up) I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (Hah, woah, woah)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (Hah, woah)

Flexin' on that bitch, hold up (Flexin' on that bitch, hah)
Bought a necklace on that bitch, hold up (21, 21)
Her friend gon' lick me like a fruit, roll up (Roll, up, roll up)
She in her feelings on the 'Gram, grow up (Savage)
21, flexin' on that bitch, hold up (Hold up)
I ain't textin' back that bitch, hold up (No way, no way)
I ain't stressin' 'bout that bitch, hold up (Savage)
21 gon' get the stick, hold up
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I like to ball (Like to ball)
Hold up, hold up, without no weave, you bald
Hold up (Bitch), bitch, I spent your rent inside the mall (21, 21)
Hold up, she got a nigga, but he broke, she lost (Savage)
Hold up, at this private location
Hold up (Hold up), put her back in rotation (Woo)
Hold up, bitches on me, immigration
Hold up, goin' through the translations

Hah, hah, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hold up)
I was just flexin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up, hah, 21)
Hold up, I was just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up, hold up)
Hold up (Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, nigga) I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (Hah, hah, hah)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (Woo, hah, woah)

Hold up (Hold up), bitch, my Rolex on fleek (On fleek)
Hold up, bitch, my diamonds on fleek (Bling, blaow)
Hold up, I got gold on my teeth (Hold up, on my teeth, teeth)
Hold up, you got Rainbow on your feet? (Broke bitch, Savage)
Hold up, corny niggas don't impress me
Hold up, never let a bitch dress me
Hold up, can't no motherfuckin' judge check me
Hold up, I don't give a fuck about no ring (Yeah)
Hold up, money make my old bitches hate me
Hold up (Hold up), bitch, you still stay on Section 8 (Broke bitch)
Hold up, my new bitch wetter than a lake (Wet as fuck)
Hold up, and she love to let me paint her face (21)
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat
Hold up, ripped them confidential papers up
Hold up, you done made me wake my savage up (21, 21, hold up, yeah)

Hah, hah, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hold up)
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up, hah, 21)
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (Hold up, hold up)
Hold up (Hold up, hold up, hold up), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21, Savage)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (Hah, hah, hah)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (Hah)

Ten bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard, then your money start expandin'
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Hendrix, bitch, but, no, I'm no Jimi
Hit 'em with no condoms, shipped her right back out the country
And I'm sippin' codeine, tats all on my stomach
