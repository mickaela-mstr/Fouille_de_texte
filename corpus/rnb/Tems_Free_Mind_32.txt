37 ContributorsFree Mind Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

[Verse 1]
I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earnings
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now, uh, yeah


[Verse 2]
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding a way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
But behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take me out
Tell you what I need right here

[Chorus]
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now, uh, yeah


[Bridge]
So set me free
Freer than the open mind
Farther than the eyes can handle
Freer than the ocean now
Yeah, yeah
So set me me free
Now I need to find release
Set me to the open sky
Now I need to free my mind, yeah

[Outro]
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
Tell me now what you need
I've been going to God
When I'm all in my mind
I might be falling deep
Falling deep
I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling, yeah
