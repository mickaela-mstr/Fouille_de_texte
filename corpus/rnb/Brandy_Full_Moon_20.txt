Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You, and your mans and them, just took over the floor
Started doing your thing, and it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me, it seemed as though
You must have somehow felt me staring on the low
Something tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

[Verse 2]
Why is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?
Could you be visiting or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case, I'm feeling you right here and right now
Your smile and all the love you're showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you


[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front (Baby)
I ain't even gonna lie (Woo)
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want (Dance if you want)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon (A full moon)
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want (Oh, oh)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

[Bridge]
I didn't think that I'd come here tonight
Meet someone like you, start feeling the way I do
Seems like we've known each other most of our lives
After one conversation, this must be right

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Ooh, baby)
Since you walked up in the club (Hey, yeah, eh)
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights (Oh, oh)
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie (I ain't even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye (Whoa, oh)
We can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)
Get it crackin' if you like (Whoa, oh)
Must be a full moon (Whoa, oh)
Feel like one of those nights
I ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)
I ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)
Since you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)
I've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)
We can dance if you want (Dance if you want)
Get it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)
Must be a full moon (A full moon)
Feel like one of those nights (One of those nights)
