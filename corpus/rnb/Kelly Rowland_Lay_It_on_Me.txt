Yeah, boy
Down, down, down
Boi, boi, boi
Kelly, I'ma make you call me B-I-G

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Last night we made a movie, and tonight'll be the sequel (Whoa)
Send a pic, let a nigga get a preview (Right now)
Come and suit it up, on my GQ (Q)
And I'ma make you take it off with your teeth too
Nasty, tonight we skinny dippin', no pool, girl (Girl)
Except the one between your legs, I'm a fool, girl (Girl)
Put your skirt on, turn you to my school girl
Smack you with my ruler, girl, you know how I do it, girl

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
What time do you get out? I wanna see you tonight
What time will you be here? I wanna hold you tonight, yeah
I wanna just kiss you now (You now)
I wanna just touch you now (You now)
I wanna just give you all my love tonight
Oh, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
And tell 'em you won't be here in the morning, oh no
Tell your little friends that you're rollin' solo
Tonight, boy, make my body go, oh
Lay it on me

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland & (Big Sean)]
I don't mind, I can wait up
'Cause I'ma enjoy the ride (Enjoy the ride)
And I know when you show up, I'ma be satisfied (Yeah, you're right, girl)
So come, come lay me down (Down)
One more time around (Time around)
Boy, just give me all that love tonight
Oh, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
And tell 'em you won't be here in the morning, oh no
Tell your little friends that you're rollin' solo
Tonight, boy, make my body go, oh
Lay it on me

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland & (Big Sean)]
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Oh, oh, lay it down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (Lay it down)
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (B-I, talk that nasty shit)
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (Do it, do it, Sean Don)
Oh, lay it on me (Yeah)


[Verse 4: Big Sean & (Kelly Rowland)]
The king of the California kings (Kings), you gotta call me sire (Sire)
Watch me lay it down (Down), and I ain't even tired (Tired)
Putting work in and I ain't even hired (Whoa)
Hitting high notes, neighbours thought you joined a choir (Knew it)
She drop it then wind with it 'cause she know that I'm liking it
Turn my lap into a chaffeur and I'll spend all day just ridin' it
Tryna clone that just to have a m√©nage with it (Oh)
Just a red light special, but I swear ain't no stopping this
Yellin', "Go, Sean, go!" (Go), said, "Shawty, bring it back (Back)
Call my dick "Curiosity" 'cause it killed the cat (Killed the cat)
And satisfaction brought it back (Oh)
Girl, it's your world, I'm just chillin' on the map

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & (Big Sean)]
(Lay it down)
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me (I do it)
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh (B-I-G)
Lay it on me (Sean Don)
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body (Yeah)
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Lay it on me (Lay it on me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah (B-I-G, Kelly)
Lay it on me (On me, on me, on me, on me)
