Oh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Chloe]
Yeah, I beat my face
Movin' fast 'cause the Uber on the way
Takin' pictures, make sure you can't see no lace
That wig secure like the money in a safe
I look like bae
Now I'm on the way
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away
When I'm outside, please don't make me wait
The party startin' when we pull up to the gate
Girl, we so late

[Pre-Chorus: Halle]
I'm just with the crew
We ain't out here lookin' for boo
'Cause some nights be better with you
It's a homies-only kind of mood
And tonight we on a hundred
One hundred
No drama, no baby mamas, keepin' it cute


[Chorus: Chloe]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it, do it, do it
You liking what I do? Do you?
Know how to keep it cool, ooh, ooh
And that's just how we do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it
And you could do it too, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Chloe]
No complaints
Left the heels at home, I'm on my sneaker game (Sneaker game)
He say, "Where you from?" Tell 'him, "Outer space" (Outer space)
'Cause a bag the only thing I'm tryna chase (Tryna chase)
I'm M.I.A. (M.I.A.)
Just tell the DJ press play, rewind, keep it on repeat
Tiptoe 'round a hater, I'm light on my feet
That's how you do it, keep stuntin' on your enemies
Good vibes only

[Pre-Chorus: Halle]
I'm just with the crew
We ain't out here looking for boo
'Cause some nights be better with you
It's a homies-only kind of mood
And tonight, we on a hundred
One hundred
No drama, no baby mamas, keepin' it cute


[Chorus: Chloe]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it, do it, do it
You liking what I do? Do you? (That's just how we do it)
Know how to keep it cool, ooh, ooh (That's just how we do it)
And that's just how we do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it (That's just how we do it)
And you could do it too, ooh, ooh, ooh (That's just how we do it)

[Outro: Chloe & Halle]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it, do it, do it
You liking what I do? Do you? (That's just how we do it, that's just how we do it)
Know how to keep it cool, ooh, ooh (That's just how we do it, that's just how we do it)
And that's just how we do it (That's just how we do it)
Yeah, that's just how we do it (That's just how we do it)
And you could do it too, ooh, ooh (I like it, like it, yeah, uh, yeah)
Yeah, that's just how we do it
