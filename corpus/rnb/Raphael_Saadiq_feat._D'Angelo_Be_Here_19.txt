(You should be here)
You should be here with me, baby
You should be here with me, baby
(You should be here)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
(You should be here)
You should be here with me, baby
(Oh-oh, ooh, girl, I wish you were here)
I just wanna drive you crazy

[Verse 1: Raphael Saadiq]
You should be here in the mornin' time when I'm makin' my breakfast
You should be here beneath me to feel me, to heal me
You should be here (You should be here) to wrap me, to trap me (To trap me) and climb me (Climb me)
You should be here, I'm a good man and I work hard on my night job

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo]
(You should be here)
Let me show you what you're missin' every day
(You should be here)
Once I get you, you ain't never gonna walk away
(You should be here)
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money
(Ooh, girl, I wish you were here, oh, oh)
You should be here, you should be here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)


[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
You should be here in the evenin'
Get to sleazin', and teasin'
Forget your reasons
Why you should not
Oh, lady, you should see the tricks that I got
Oh, for you, mama (Oh)
Especially here
Be my lady
Let's get lazy
And make babies
Oh

[Chorus: D'Angelo, Raphael Saadiq]
(You should be here)
Let me show you what you're missin' every day, yeah (Oh)
(You should be here)
Once I get you, you ain't never gonna walk away, yeah
(You should be here)
See, I got more than just some good dick and some money
(Ooh, girl, I wish you were here)
You should be here, you should be here
('Cause I don't like bein' lonely)

[Refrain: Raphael Saadiq]
You should be here with me, baby (Uh)
You should be here with me, baby
Girl, you know you drive me crazy (Yeah)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
You should be here with me, baby (Uh)
You should be here with me, baby
I just wanna drive you crazy (Yeah)
I just wanna drive you crazy


[Bridge: Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo,&  Both]
You should be here
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)
You should be here
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
You should be here
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Ooh, girl, I wish you were here
I wish you were here with me, baby
Girl, I wish you were here

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo]
(You should be here)
Now, you don't know what you are missin' every day (You don't know, oh, yeah)
(You should be here)
Well, in my dreams last night I think I had you every way (Oh-oh)
(You should be here)
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money (I got more, yeah)
(Ooh, girl, I wish you were here, yeah)
You should be here, you should be here, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
