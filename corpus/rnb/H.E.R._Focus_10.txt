Me (Me, me, me)
Can you focus on me? (Me, me)
Baby, can you focus on me? (Focus on me)
Babe

[Verse 1]
Hands in the soap (Soap)
Have the faucets running
And I keep looking at you
(Looking at you, looking at you)
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up (Give up, give up)
Baby, I just want you to get up (Get up, get up)
Lately, I've been a little fed up (Fed up, fed up)
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?


[Verse 2]
Lazy and broke? (Broke)
No, he get this money
So I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately, I've been a little fed up (A little fed up, yeah)
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me
Can you focus on me? (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

[Outro]
Baby, baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes, ooh
