20 ContributorsAscension (Donâ€™t Ever Wonder) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It happened the moment, when you were revealed
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating, baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved
Gave me paradise

[Chorus]
So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (Don't ever wonder)
So shouldn't I realize (Shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

[Verse 2]
So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe?
'Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life


[Chorus]
So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder, wonder (Don't ever wonder)
Shouldn't I realize (Ooh, shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high (That you're the highest of the high)
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (Don't ever wonder)
Shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (Don't ever, don't ever wonder)

[Outro]
Ooh (Don't ever wonder)
Ooh (Don't ever wonder)
(Don't ever wonder)

Never question me (Don't ever wonder)
Without you, there's no me (Don't ever wonder)
(Don't ever wonder)

Can't you see? (Don't ever wonder)
Can't you see? (Don't ever wonder)
(Don't ever wonder)
