43 ContributorsCome Through Lyrics[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
Almost missed my flight today
I look good, even though I feel shitty
I just got back out this way
You already got plans for the city
Call 'em off, could you call 'em off for me?
You're always going on and on
Got it all, ask me why I never leave
I don't go out much

[Chorus: H.E.R., H.E.R. & Chris Brown]
But you should come through tonight
I'm chillin' on the Westside, boo
Call my homegirl, tell your best friend
You can slide too, on the low, a remote location
I don't want them see me gettin' faded
You should come through tonight
I only kick it with a tight crew
They won't tell, 'cause they tryna live they best life too
On the low, on my own, I be wavy
Hit mе on my phone, I'll be waitin', yeah-yеah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & H.E.R.]
Lookin' at you cry, goin' crazy
If I could, I would take the pain away
I don't see that smile I made
You already made plans that ain't with me
Tryin' hard, I been tryin' hard to breathe
Inhale, exhale, you expel what you been doin' to me
Fightin' it off, you been fightin' me off for weeks
Don't leave, 'cause I need ya


[Chorus: H.E.R. & Chris Brown, H.E.R., Chris Brown]
But you should come through tonight
I'm chillin' on the Westside, boo
Call my homegirl, tell your best friend
You can slide too, on the low, a remote location
I don't want them see me gettin' faded (Yeah)
You should come through tonight (Yeah)
I only kick it with a tight crew (Yeah)
They won't tell, 'cause they tryna live they best life too (No)
On the low, on my own, I be wavy (Yeah)
Hit me on my phone, I'll be waitin', yeah-yeah

[Verse 3: H.E.R. & Chris Brown, H.E.R.]
I ain't really tryna spend no time (No time)
In the house, if you ask me how I'm feelin' (Feelin')
I say "yes" to goin' out tonight
Oh, I ain't did that in a minute
Called it off, oh, I called it off for you
You always goin' on and on
Ask me why, oh, why I'm not with you
I don't go out much

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Chris Brown, H.E.R., Chris Brown]
But you should come through tonight (Yeah)
I'm chillin' on the Westside, boo
Call my homegirl, tell your best friend (Best, oh)
You can slide too, on the low, a remote location
I don't want them see me gettin' faded
You should come through tonight
I only kick it with a tight crew (Yeah)
They won't tell, 'cause they tryna live they best life too (Woah)
On the low, on my own, I be wavy
Hit me on my phone, I'll be waitin' (Yeah), yeah-yeah


[Outro: H.E.R.]
Waitin', oh
Hit me on my phone, I'll be waitin', waitin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Hit me on my phone, hit me on my phone, yeah
Oh, I'll be waitin', yeah
Hittin' me alone, oh, yeah-yeah
Give me a call, oh, yeah-yeah
Give me a call, yeah
