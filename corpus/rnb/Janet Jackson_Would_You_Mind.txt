That's it
Would you mind...?
Would you mind...?

[Verse 1]
Baby, would you mind touching me?
Ever so slowly
You're making me quiver
And baby, would you mind undressing me?
Making me feel sexy
While in the moment

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna bathe you, play with you, rub you, caress you, tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you, tease you, lick you, please you, love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you deep inside me
I just wanna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you, make you cum too

[Spoken]
I wanna make you cum

[Verse 2]
Baby, would you mind kissing me
All over my body?
You missed a spot, there
And baby, would you mind tasting me?
It's making me all juicy
Feelin' your lips on mine


[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna bathe you, play with you, rub you, caress you, tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you, tease you, lick you, please you, love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you deep inside me (I wanna feel you)
I just wanna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you
Feel you, make you cum too

[Spoken]
Are you ready?

[Verse 3]
Baby, would you mind
(Cum inside of me)
Letting your juices free
Deep in my passion
(Is it good to you, baby?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna bathe you, play with you, rub you, caress you, tell you how much I've missed you
(I missed you)
I just wanna touch you, tease you, lick you, please you, love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you deep inside me, ooh
I just wanna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you, make you cum too

[Spoken]
Oh, baby
Would you mind?


[Chorus]
I just wanna touch you, tease you, lick you, please you, love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna, kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you deep inside me, ooh
I just wanna, kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you, feel you, make you cum too

[Spoken]
Oh, yeah, baby, ooh
Just like that, ooh yeah
Ooh, don't move
Oh, baby
Go deeper
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, oh baby
Oh, oh my, oh baby, shit
Oh, oh, baby
Yes, oh, my, oh

[Outro]
The song ended
What the? I didn't even get to cum
Did you?
