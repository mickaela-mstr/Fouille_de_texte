Two, one

[Chorus]
Take me back to the distance (Distance, distance, distance)
Late night cooking in the kitchen
Yeah-ayy-ayy, yeah-ayy-ayy
Dirty dancing in my room
Room, room
Sending my love all over you

[Refrain]
Because of the time we shared
Time we lost in love with one another
Days we had, pay the cost of losin'
Hearts desire, so soon
I'll be sending my love all over you

[Verse]
I still get so lost in the feeling (Feeling)
And I can't imagine losin' you (You)
Ooh, ooh
Oh woah, if your heart could find a new reason
For someone special to hold on to
I wonder if I would do, ayy-yeah


[Refrain]
Because of the time we shared
Time we lost in love with one another
Days we had, pay the cost of losin'
Hearts desire, so soon (So soon, so very soon)
I'll be sending my love all over you

[Chorus]
Take me back to the distance (Distance, distance, distance)
Oh yeah, babe
Late night cooking in the kitchen
Dirty dancing in my room
I, I love the things you do, ooh and I'm
Sending all of my love to you, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I'll be sending all my love (I'll be sending, I'll be sending, I'll be sending)
You're the only one that I've been dreamin' of, it's true (Sending, sending)
I'll be sending all my love
(Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over) I'll be sending all my love
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
Over you, over
Sending my love all over you
