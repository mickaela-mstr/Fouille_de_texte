Baby, while we're young
I think we should do something crazy
Like say, "Fuck everyone"
And just run away from the daily routine
Yeah, you know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tellin' everybody you're mine and I like it
And I really hope you don't mind, I can't fight it
No, you know I cannot hide it 'cause I am so excited
That I finally decided on you
'Cause it's been another perfect day with ya
Wanna lay with ya
Spend the night with ya
Then spend my life with ya, alright
Alright, alright
Yeah, you heard me right

[Chorus]
I'll go everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go, I'll go
Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go, I'll go
Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go
You know I'll go, I'll go)
Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go
You know I'll go, I'll go)


[Verse 2]
Uh
Baby, while we're young we should just have fun
We should just do whatever we want
And tell everyone that we fell in love with each other
Ooh, that we found the one in one another

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tellin' everybody you're mine and I like it (I like it)
And I really hope you don't mind, I can't fight it (Don't fight it)
No, you know I cannot hide it 'cause I am so excited
That I finally decided on you (Oh yeah)
'Cause it's been another perfect day with ya (Perfect day)
Wanna lay with ya (I wanna lay)
Spend the night with ya
Spend my life with you, alright
You know I'm down to ride
(You know I am down to ride
You know I am down to ride)

[Bridge]
I'm giving you my heart, please don't break it
Take it and lock it up and put me in your pocket, love
Alright, right by your side

[Chorus]
I'll go everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go, I'll go
Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go, I'll go
Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go, you know I'll go
You know I'll go
(I'll go everywhere you go
You know I'll go, I'll go)


[Outro]
Baby, while we're young
We should rush and do something dumb
We should, we should, we should
We should just say "Fuck everyone"
And walk hand in hand to the sun
