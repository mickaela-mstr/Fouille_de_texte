“Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” was never meant to be a commercial… Read More [Refrain]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch (Heaven to touch)
I wanna hold you so much (Hold you so much)
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse]
Pardon the way that I stare (The way that I stare)
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak (Words left to speak)
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Chorus]
I need you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby—


[Refrain]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you (Eyes off of you)
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much (Hold you so much)
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Chorus]
I need you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby
I need you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby
