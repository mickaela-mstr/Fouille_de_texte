Fresh out the box
Stop, look, and watch
Ready yet, get set
It's All That!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
This is All That
This is All That!

[Verse]
Check it, check it, check it
Now this is just an introduction
Before I blow your mind
The show is All of That and yes we do it all the time
So sit your booty on the floor or in a chair
Ground or in the air
Just don't go nowhere
Cause everything we do
(It's all of that!)
When entertaining you
(We all of that!)
My posse and my crew
(It's all of that!)
So sit still cause we're coming right back


[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
This is All That
This is All That!
