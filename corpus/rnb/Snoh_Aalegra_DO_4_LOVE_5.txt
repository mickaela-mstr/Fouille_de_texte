11 ContributorsDO 4 LOVE Lyrics[Verse 1]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

[Verse 2]
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love (Do for love)
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
And in my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

[Verse 3]
Now my friends wonder what is wrong with mе
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
Now I camе back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go


[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love (Do for love)
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
And in my world, only you (Only you)
Make me do for love what I would not do (Would not do)
