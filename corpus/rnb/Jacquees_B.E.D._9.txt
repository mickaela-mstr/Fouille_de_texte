79 ContributorsB.E.D. Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Nash B chillin')

[Chorus]
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly

[Verse 1]
Ay, what it is? What you wanna know?
I done ripped about a hundred shows
You'll be coming back to me
Ay, you'll be coming back to me
Always worried 'bout them other hoes
And you'll be on me when the money throw
And they be looking out for Quees
And they be looking out for Quees
Bitch bad, no Kanye, when we do it, do it our way
2015 Wanya, I give no damn 'bout what ya mom say
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit, 21 with no kids
'Bout to rain on a bitch, I'ma rain on a bitch


[Chorus]
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, she the action, don't know why you actin'
She on ready-set-go, she will never let go
Need it all, fuck a fraction
Know she think I'm Michael Jackson
Billie Jean, moonwalk
I need the front and the back end
She in love with the fashion
But she in love with the flashin'
Bitch, this ain't ya money
Bitch, I spend it on you 'cause you know I have it
With my woes in the 6, ex-hoes, yeah, they sick
I'ma rain on a bitch, let me rain on a bitch

[Chorus]
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl, you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly


[Outro]
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit (Say yeah), 21 with no kids (Say yeah)
I'ma rain on a bitch (Say yeah), really rain on a bitch (Say yeah)
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit (Say yeah), 21 with no kids (Say yeah)
I'ma rain on a bitch (Say yeah), really rain on a bitch (Say yeah)
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit (Say yeah), 21 with no kids (Say yeah)
I'ma rain on a bitch (Say yeah), really rain on a bitch (Say yeah)
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit (Say yeah), 21 with no kids (Say yeah)
I'ma rain on a bitch (Say yeah), really rain on a bitch (Say yeah)
Say yeah, say yeah
