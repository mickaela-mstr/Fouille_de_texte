Baby, baby
There will always be a space for you and me
Right where you left it
And just maybe
Enough time will pass
We'll look back and laugh
Just don't forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm wrong
For writing this song
Losing my head over you

[Chorus]
And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same, always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase
I'm always-ways-ways
Always-ways-ways
I'm always-ways-ways


[Verse 2]
Pretty lady, used to walk with me
Down Bloor street, oh, what a time
And I still remember the fussin', thе fightin', the fuckin', the lyin'
It's all fine, you'll always bе mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm wrong (Hey, babe, you could)
For writing this song (Write me a song)
Losing my head over you

[Chorus]
And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same, always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase
I'm always-ways-ways
Always-ways-ways
I'm always-ways-ways

[Outro]
Always, can count on it sure as the stars in the sky
Always, you can count on it as sure as the sun will rise
Always, my love for you ain't goin' nowhere
Always, I will be here
