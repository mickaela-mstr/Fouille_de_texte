Go, go, go, go
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud
(Turn the lights on)

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
(And when we're done) I don't wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Lil Wayne]
But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there (You can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here
Baby, I'mma be your motivation (Uh-huh, yeah)
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
M-make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that Sweet and Low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I'm her transportation
'Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I'm racing
When I'm done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby


[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there (You can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
Oh lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same, no
I won't let you get up out that game, no
So go lover, go 'n make me rain

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
(And when we're done) I don't wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here
Baby, I'mma be your motivation
