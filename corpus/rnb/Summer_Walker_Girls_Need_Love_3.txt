Honestly

[Verse 1]
Honestly, I'm tryin' to stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now, better swing my way
I just need some dick, I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby, I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug, ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby, I'ma need more than a hug

[Chorus]
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now oh now

[Verse 2]
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason, baby
I want it 'til you can't fight
I can give it to you right, babe, oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, and you can't judge


[Chorus]
Girls need love, too (Yeah)
Girls, girls need love, too (Ooh)
Girls need love (Let me tell you something)
Girls need love (Girls need loving, too, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too
(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving, too?)
Girls need love, too
Girls, girls need love, too
