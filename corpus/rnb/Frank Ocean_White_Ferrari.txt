[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body

Basic takes its toll on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still, and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kanye West]
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)

And that's life (Love)

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin' (Woo), your body's achin' (Woah)
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't (The way) all that there is
Can't take what's been given (No way)
But we're so okay here (We're fine), we're doing fine (We're fine)
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison (Love)
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
