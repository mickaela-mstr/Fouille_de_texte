Hey love, thought that I’d just share my day
It felt a little bit crazy, baby
I cleaned the closet so I’m out of your way
Guess you can have your space
Well, I thought that I should write a letter
Then I thought this would be better, don’t yell

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
There’s a million ways that I could tell you
But I think I’d rather show you it’s over
And I won’t be back no more

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Gave you my heart, it slipped through your fingers
Now you're the one to blame
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Oh love, your dinner’s waiting down the street
And you can have it your way
So love, the mess you made is yours to clean
So don’t be looking at me
See, I don’t mean to disrespect you
But I think you could’ve done me better, don’t you?
You fool


[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
There’s a million ways that I could tell you
But I think I’d rather show you it’s over
And I won’t be back no more

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Gave you my heart, it slipped through your fingers
Now you're the one to blame
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Where you going? What you doing?
Oh, you must be at the point
Where you can't take this no more
So you grabbing your stuff, walking out the door
Moving so fast, forgot what we was even arguing for
Man, I know you like the back of my hand
You like to break up then make up
Roll me up a joint soon as I wake up
When I put it down, mess up your makeup
Everything provided when you rolling with a rider
You been in Hollywood so long
Your ass starting to act Hollywood
Talking 'bout you go leave, probably should
I ain't trippin', just a bunch of extra shit
I ain't missing, my sister tried to tell me 'bout you
I ain't listen, now we going down this road
Hit the smoke, said "bro, I've been here before"
And you know Kelly never lied
So you can get your stuff and get to going
I'll get back to getting high


[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland & (Wiz Khalifa)]
There’s a million ways that I could tell you
But I think I’d rather show you it’s over (it's over)
And I won’t be back no more (never again)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Gave you my heart, it slipped through your fingers
Now you're the one to blame
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Sing

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've...
One more time
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Good try
Slip through your fingers now you're the one done changed...
Oh, my, shut the fuck up
