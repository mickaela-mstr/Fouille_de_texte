I (I), I, I

[Chorus: Ari Lennox, Jazmine Sullivan, Ari Lennox & Jazmine Sullivan]
I want to sit on it
So tell me why (Why) you deserve it
Come on and prove (Prove, prove)
Why I should move (Move, move)
Spit on it (Pur')

[Verse 1: Ari Lennox]
I need more than a text message
You gon' have to pull off somethin' impressive
Curves got you drivin' reckless
Take this water and hydrate, bitch

[Chorus: Ari Lennox, Ari Lennox & Jazmine Sullivan]
I want to sit on it (Baby, baby, baby)
But tell me why (Why) you deserve it
Come on and prove (Come on and prove)
Why I should move
I, I, I'll spit on it, it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
'Cause I heard somе freaky shit 'bout you
So let me see what that mouth do
'Causе baby it's not that easy to please me
Yeah I'm needy, yeah I need more attention
With different positions (Oh, oh, oh)


[Chorus: Ari Lennox, Ari Lennox & Jazmine Sullivan]
I'll sit on it, yeah (Oh)
I want you to prove it (Oh, oh, oh)
Baby come on and prove (Come on and prove)
Why I should move
Baby look at me, baby I'll spit on it

[Verse 3: Ari Lennox & Jazmine Sullivan]
Uh, ah, hey
Say you one hell of a canoe
Got it wetter than the whole Chesapeake Bay
Nothing's stoppin' you
Be the Nia to the hood Larenz Tate(Ooh)
Dive in it (Ooh), take your time with it (Ooh)
Lil' bowlegged hood nigga with the nine inch (Ooh)
Put it in my face
Baby crash into these waves
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Ari Lennox & Jazmine Sullivan, Jazmine Sullivan]
Let me sit on it, yeah
I want you to prove it (You deserve it)
Baby come on and prove (Come on and prove)
Why I should move
I want to spit on it
