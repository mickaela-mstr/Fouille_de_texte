Crazy—I go, I go, I go, I go

[Verse 1]
Everything I do, I do it with a passion (With a passion)
If I gotta be a bitch, I'ma be a bad one (Be a bad one)
I'm A.I. with the designs, du-ragging (Du-ragging)
Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah-yeah, yeah, pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven (Yeah)
They be tryna count me out though (Yeah)
I'm just countin', countin' blessings
A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Boy, I really-really came up
You never could say I'm lacking
All this shit I've been through
And it made me more of an assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion
And baby, if they askin'

[Chorus]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy


[Verse 2]
Lit-lit, lit-lit, only L I take is to the face
You showed up to see me lose
But I overcome so you overcame
Basic, basic, ain't nothin' 'bout me basic
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, better watch what you say to me
'Cause Young Sway got the answers (Yah)
Give 'em hell, give 'em pressure (Ayy)
VIP couch, no manners, dirty-dirty-dirty dancin'
Take a look at what I did, go for circle with the wrist
Whippin'-whippin' up the grits, get a handful of this nasty
I got it, I got it, I got it and you gon' respect it
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin'
Gon' stop me from makin' it happen
So baby, if they askin'

[Chorus]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy

[Outro]
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy, crazy
