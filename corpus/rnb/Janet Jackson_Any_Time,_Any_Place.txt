In the thundering rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
And I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is

[Chorus]
Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
Mm
Ooh, any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
No, no, no, no, no


[Verse 2]
Dancing on the floor
Feeling the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could
Well, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop, baby)
People standing around are watching us (Standing 'round are watching us)
I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn)
I want you now (I want you now)
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop)
You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love)
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no)
I want you (I want you now)
All I wanna say is

[Chorus]
Ooh, any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Any time, baby
And any place
I don't care who's around (Say it again, say it, oh yeah)
Any time (Any time)
And any place
I don't care who's around


[Post-Chorus]
Baby, baby
I don't care who's around

[Outro]
Any time, baby
Any place, sugar
They can watch, they can stare, I don't care, ooh-ooh-ooh
