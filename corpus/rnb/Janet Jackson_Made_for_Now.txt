[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
If you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, and celebrate the feelin'
Go up, if you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, 'cause there ain't no ceilings
Go up

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee]
Arriba la raza, estamos en la casa
Dale suelta en banda to' lo que te atrasa
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
We don't stop it, no te escapas
Yo soy volcán pero tú eres lava
Seguimos lighty, lighty, prendí'os
Vívelo hoy, que mañana se acaba

Right now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (Right now)

They're made for now (Right now)
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around

We're made for now
Not tomorrow

Look around
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now

[Post-Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Janet Jackson]
Everybody move your body (Right now), everybody (Right now)
We're made for now
Everybody move your body (Right now), everybody (Right now)

Da una vuelta y ponte pa' mí (Right now), ponte pa' mí (Right now) (Ponte, ponte, ponte)
We're made for now
Da una vuelta y ponte pa' mí (Right now), ponte pa' mí (Right now)
We're made for now
