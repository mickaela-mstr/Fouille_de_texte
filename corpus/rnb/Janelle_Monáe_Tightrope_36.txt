(Monáe and Leftfoot)
Whoa (Ye-yeah)
Another day (Da-ba-dee, Náe)
I take your pain away (Huh, come on)

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down, they doubt ya
And when you tip it on the scene
Yeah, they talkin' 'bout it
'Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it
T-t-t-talkin' 'bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
'Cause baby, whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
Baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it


[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
See, I'm not walkin' on it
Or tryin' to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout ya
Keep on blaming the machine
Yeah, I'm talkin' bout it
T-t-t-talkin' 'bout it
I can't complain about it
I gotta keep my balance
And just keep dancin' on it
We gettin' funky on the scene
Yeah, you know about it
Like a star on the screen
Watch me tip all on it

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Then baby, whether I'm high or low (High or low)
Baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
Ooh, you gotta tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Yeah, tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
Baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
Tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, let me see you tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it


[Verse 3: Big Boi]
You gotta keep your balance or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge, but I manage 'cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage? Damn, a thought that cannot pass
See, why you don't want no friction like the back of a matchbook?
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you and your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down before we go broke backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low, we gonna get back up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in an ass crack
Come on

[Verse 4: Janelle Monáe]
I tip on alligators
And little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it?
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner
And you know exactly what I mean
Yeah, I'm talkin 'bout you
You can rock or you can leave
Watch me tip without you


[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
N-n-now whether I'm high or low (High or low)
Whether I'm high or low (High or low)
I'm gonna tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Mmm (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, whether I'm high or low (High or low)
High or low (High or low)
I got to tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Now baby, tip on the tightrope

[Bridge: Janelle Monáe]
You can't get too high (We can't get too high)
I said you can't get too low (We can't get too low)
Ha, 'cause you get too high (You can't get too high)
No, you'll surely be low (No, you'll surely be low)
One, two, three, oh

[Interlude: Janelle Monáe]
Yeah, yeah
Now shut up, yeah
Yeah, now put some voodoo on it
Ladies and gentlemen, the funkiest horn section in Metropolis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
We call that classy brass

[Bridge 2: Janelle Monáe]
I gotta keep my balance (Ooh)
I gotta keep my balance (Ooh)
I gotta (Well, it's a thin line)
I gotta, got-got-gotta k-keep, keep, keep my balance
Oh
Like a terminator, gotta keep, keep, keep my balance
(Well, it's a thin line)
Got-got-gotta k-keep, keep, keep my balance
(Not that white line)
I gotta keep my balance
(Even your white line)
Queen, yeah, I gotta keep my balance

[Outro: Janelle Monáe]
Do you mind?
If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
Do you mind?
If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
As I play the ukulele
If I play my ukulele
Just like a little lady
