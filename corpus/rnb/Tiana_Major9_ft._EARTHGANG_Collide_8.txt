23 ContributorsCollide Lyrics[Verse 1: Olu]
Everybody's got opinions on our thing
Say we're flying down a path with no ending
And if I die before I wake
Ooh, don't let me wake 'em from this dream

[Chorus: Olu]
When we collide
When we collide, it's a beautiful disaster
When I crash into you, you, you
Crash into you, you, you

[Verse 2: Tiana Major9]
I've been so frustrated, have to let it out (Have to let it out)
Let me tell you with my body what I'm talking 'bout (Let me tell you, let me tell you, oh)
And I don't care about the future or the past (I don't care, I don't care no more)
Riding slow 'cause you know the world's moving too fast

[Chorus: Tiana Major9]
When we collide
When we collide, it's a beautiful disaster
When I crash into you, you, you
Crash into you, you, you

[Bridge: Olu & Tiana Major9]
Without you, I'm just a fraction
Closing in on my demise
And I love you religiously
With everything inside of me
As long as I'm
As long as I'm alive


[Chorus: Tiana Major9 & Olu, Tiana Major9]
When we collide
When we collide, it's a beautiful disaster
When I crash into you, you, you
Crash into you, you, you
When we collide
When we collide, it's a beautiful disaster
When I crash into you, you, you
Crash into you, you, you
