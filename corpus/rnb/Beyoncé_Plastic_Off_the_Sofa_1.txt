Boy, I know you can't help but to be yourself 'round me
Yourself 'round me, no
And I know nobody's perfect, so I'll let you be
I'll let you be
It's the way you wear your emotions on both of your sleeves, oh
To the face you make when I tell you that I have to leave, ooh

[Chorus]
But I like it, baby
Ooh, I like it, baby
But I like it, baby, baby
But I like it, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, we don't need the world's acceptance, they're too hard on me
They're too hard on you, boy
I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growin' up, but that's okay (That's okay, baby)
I like it rough (That's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (Let your feelings get in the way)

[Chorus]
I still like it, baby
Ooh, I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
But I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
Baby, baby (Like it, baby)
I still like it, baby
Baby, baby, baby


[Bridge]
Say, say you won't change
I love the little things that make you you
Ooh, the rest of the world is strange, stay in our lane
Just you and me and our family
I think you're so cool
(Even though I'm cooler than you)

[Verse 3]
Boy, I love that you can't help but be yourself around me
Yourself around me
Sugar, well, you're trippin', I know we'll make up and make love
So I'll let you be
I'll let you be
It's the way you listen when I'm cryin', you let me lean in
It's the way you want one more kiss after you said you were leaving

[Chorus]
But I like it, baby (Yes, I like it, baby)
Babe (Yes, I like it, baby)
Yes, I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
Like it (Like it), I like it
I love it, baby
I like it, baby
I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby, yeah, I like it, oh, like it
I like it, yeah
I like, I like it, baby
I like it, baby


[Outro]
I like it, baby
Baby, come on over
Ooh, I like it, baby
Who loves you, baby? Baby
