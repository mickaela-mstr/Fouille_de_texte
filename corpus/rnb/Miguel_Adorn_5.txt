She's art dealer chic
Would you be my friend, my freak?
Uh, she's art dealer chic (Yeah)
Would you be my friend, my freak?

[Verse 1]
These lips (Would you be my fâ€”)
Can't wait to taste your skin (My friend, my freak)
Baby, no, oh, no (Would you be my friend, my freak?)
And these eyes, yeah
I can't wait to see your grin (Art dealer chic)
Ooh, ooh, baby

[Chorus 1]
Just let my love
Just let my love adorn you (Art dealer chic)
Please, baby (Would you be my friend, my freak?)
Yeah, you gotta know, you gotta know
You know that I adore you (Art dealer chic)
Yeah, baby (Would you be my friend, my freak?)

[Verse 2]
Baby these fists (Art dealer chic)
Will always protect you (My friend, my freak)
Lady (Would you be my friend, my freak?)
And this mind
Will never neglect you (Art dealer chic)
Yeah baby  (Would you be my), ooh, ooh
And if they try to break us down (Ooh-ooh)
Don't let that affect us
No, baby


[Chorus 2]
You just gotta let my love
Let my love, let my love adorn you (Art dealer chic)
Ahh, le-le-le-let it dress you down
You gotta know, you gotta know
Know that I adore you (Art dealer chic)
Just that, baby
Oh, let my love adorn you, baby
Don't you ever, don't you let nobody tell you different, baby
I'll always adore you
You gotta know now
You gotta know na-nah-now, yeah
(Would you be my friend, my freak?)

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, uh
The same way that the stars adorn the skies, yeah
(Every night, babe)
Now look up sugar (Every night, babe)
Now hey, hey, hey
The same way that my whole world's in your eyes (When I look in your eyes babe)
Ooh, and it's time now (And you know it's time babe)

[Chorus 3]
Just let, let my love
Do you, baby
Hey, le-le-le-let it dress you down
You got to know baby, oh you gotta know
That I adorn you, yeah
Oh, love ain't never looked so good on you

Oh, put it on, baby
Let my love adorn
You
