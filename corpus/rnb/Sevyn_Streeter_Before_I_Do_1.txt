22 ContributorsBefore I Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard about you and your other situation
Through word of mouth
They made it seem so complicated
Is it over now?
Or did you just say it 'cause you're anxious?
To get closer now
'Cause I want you to be all over me

[Pre-Hook]
Truthfully (Truthfully)
Honestly (Honestly)
I need, I need, I need to believe
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Say it ain't so, you ain't on the low
I don't think I could handle it
I wanna go to another level, with you

[Hook]
But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
Oh yeah, so tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you

[Verse 2]
I heard about, heard all about your reputation
You know word gets around
Tell me you got an explanation
'Cause I need to know
Is it nothing?
Is it something?
Ohh, just keep it real with me


[Pre-Hook]
Truthfully (Truthfully)
Honestly (Honestly)
I need, I need, I need to believe
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Say it ain't so, you ain't on the low
I don't think I could handle it
I wanna go to another level, with you

[Hook]
But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
So tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you

[Bridge]
It's unfair, 'cause baby in my mind, ohh
We should be together, whoa
I wanna let go, but I don't really know
I heard you got a girlfriend (Girlfriend)
I'm tryna go, to another level, with you

[Hook]
But before I do
I wanna know before I go there with you
So tell me you're through
I need to know before I go there with you


[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
