36 ContributorsKelly Lyrics[Verse 1]
My skin is my cape, huh
My black is not beige, huh
Natural face, huh
That's how I wake up
No love for the fake ones
You get what you give, huh
Bills, bills, bills been spent
Kelendria rich, huh?
Ta-talk to ya nice, but this shit ain't sweet
Whole 'nother side that you never seen
I sew my tithes, you watch emâ€™ reap
I talk to God, my minutes are free (free)

[Pre-Chorus]
Two double G's, this two double G cost a walk-through fee
Lil' shit back then, I let that slide, ain't get by me
All they tryna get is a "@" from me and it's all for the reach
B-back up off of me, back up off of me
Rose petals at my feet (ahh!)

[Chorus]
Kelly got bands, Kelly got a check
Kelly got wig, Kelly got deals
Kelly got class, Kelly got ass
Kelly got a man, Kelly pop tags
Kelly got flex, Kelly got wheels
Kelly got drip, Kelly got a stash
Kelly got a house, big house on a hill
Kelly's so blessed, thick, plus, XL
Kelly ain't, Kelly ain't got no chill
Kelly don't really give a fuck how you feel
Kelly ain't humble no mo', nigga
Kelly got her foot on yo' throat, nigga
Kelly ain't humble no mo', nigga
Kelly got her foot on yo throat, nigga


[Post-Chorus]
Go, Kelly, go
Go, go, Kelly, go
Go, Kelly, go
Go, go, Kelly

[Verse 2]
Cop that bag if it's designer
I'm so rich that I ain't buy it
Don't get tired, I'm too wired
Light it up and get inspired
All my business, keep it private
You know bosses move in silence
And I ride it like it's stolen
'Cause my name is Kelly Rowland, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I meet the quota
Bitch, y'all really thought it was over
I'll always be around, thought I told ya
Back up off of me, back up off of me
'Fore I get to clapping like the Noila

[Chorus]
Kelly got bands, Kelly got a check
Kelly got wig, Kelly got deals
Kelly got class, Kelly got ass
Kelly got a man, Kelly pop tags
Kelly got flex, Kelly got wheels
Kelly got drip, Kelly got a stash
Kelly got a house, big house on a hill
Kelly's so blessed, thick, plus, XL
Kelly ain't, Kelly ain't got no chill
Kelly don't really give a fuck how you feel
Kelly ain't humble no mo', nigga
Kelly got her foot on yo' throat, nigga
Kelly ain't humble no mo', nigga
Kelly got her foot on yo' throat, nigga


[Post-Chorus]
Go, Kelly, go
Go, go, Kelly, go
Go, Kelly, go
Go, go, Kelly
