Daylight
I wake up feelin' like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishin' I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
(If you want it) Yeah
(You can have it) Oh, oh, oh
(If you need it) Ooh
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes


[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late

I'm tryin' not to waste my time

(If you want it) Oh
(You can have it) You can have it
(If you need it) You better believe in somethin'
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
(You can have it) Ahh!

[Chorus]
But stay woke (Stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (They be creepin')
They gon' find you (They gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now, baby)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke (Ooh-ahh)
Niggas creepin' (They gon' find you)
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh (Gon' catch you, gon' catch you)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes


[Outro]
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, how'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, oh, baby, you, how'd it get
How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
But stay woke
But stay woke
