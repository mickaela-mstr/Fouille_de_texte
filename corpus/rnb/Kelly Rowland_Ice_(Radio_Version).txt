23 ContributorsIce (Radio Version) Lyrics“Ice” was originally intended as the lead single from Rowland’s fourth studio album, Talk a Good Game, but was scrapped as the lead and was not included on the album’s final tracklisting.[Intro]
Smash, smash, smash
Smash on the radio
It's Kelly Rowland

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Pull up (ah, ah)
She been purring like a kitten craving your love (ah, ah)
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what we did last time, and now
When you (When you)
Come and lay between it this time
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my navel, and watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle, my legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice (Nice)
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot


[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
You put the pillow (Right there)
Underneath my back
Got me up against the window (Right now)
We got no shame, we going in
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, "Damn, my man knows what he's doing"
The mirrors (Oh, the mirrors)
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual (So visual)
Babe I ain't never feel so right (Right)
Yeah (Yeah)
He comes again, my body going numb (Numb)
Hot as ice, can't get enough

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland, Lil Wayne]
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice (Nice)
You're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot (Me and Ms. Kelly)
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot (On another track)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, ice, ice baby
Shake that...just like dice baby
You hot, and I'm Tunechi
I beat that cat, animal cruelty
I'm colder than your man, he should be your ex
Now throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch (R-R-Right)
And all your hear is "What's my name?", it's yo...
Sweet tooth, roll Tootsie
If you are what you eat, I'm so (so)
I'm skating on thin ice, I put in her....
We do it 'til we both exhausted, twin pipes
Pillow under her stomach, the other pillow she bite
Would you like anything, cause I'll do anything you like, um
I make her freeze up, pick her knees up
She want a maid..., watch me clean up
I know where to put it, I put it in her life
I leave that... smoking, smoking like ice


[Chorus: Kelly Rowland, Lil Wayne]
You're like ice (Tunechi)
I-C-E, feels so nice (Nice, Whoo!)
Scorching me (Young Mula, baby)
You're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot (Uh, yeah)
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot (I got that comeback, ha, ha)
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice (Nice)
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
