It's not that I don't want you here (Yeah, yeah)
It's somethin' 'bout the way you stare into my eyes
I know that I don't make things clear (No)
I fall for you every time I try to resist you

[Refrain]
We can get away
Palm trees, beach views
Ordinary day
All I wanna hear is Innervisions on replay
And sit right next to you, you
I try not to show how I feel about you
Thinkin' we should wait, but we don't really want to
I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna kiss you yet
I just wanna feel you
Feel you

[Chorus]
I want you around (Around)
Around
I want you around (Around)
Around ('Round, 'round, 'round)
I want you around
Around
I want you around
Around, around, 'round, 'round


[Post-Chorus]
I want you around

[Verse 2]
Come through, I think I need you here (What)
I swear it's hard to keep these feelings to myself
Now you're the one I'm thinkin' of
My higher ground, my rocket love
Fuck gravity, I'd rather stay up here, but...

[Refrain]
We can get away
Palm trees, beach views
Ordinary day
All I wanna hear is Innervisions on replay
And sit right next to you, you
I try not to show how I feel about you
Thinkin' we should wait, but we don't really want to
I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna kiss you yet
I just wanna feel you
Feel you


[Chorus]
I want you around (Around)
Around
I want you around (Around)
Around ('Round, 'round)
I want you around (Know that I want you, yeah, yeah)
Around
I want you around (I want you around, yeah, yeah)
Around, around, 'round, 'round

[Outro]
I want you around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Oh, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
Want you around
