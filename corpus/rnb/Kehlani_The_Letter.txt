I can hear your laugh
It's ringing through the hallways
I can see your smile
It's what gets me through my hard days
And your words were supposed to get me through my heartache
Before my heartbreak
There's an emptiness that only a few ever feel
And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal

[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Verse 2]
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide
Why, oh, why didn't you just live your life?
And every girl needs a mother
And, damn it, I needed you
Instead, you ducked for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof


[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
And maybe I don't understand it
Tell me, is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded?
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Outro]
Maybe I didn't deserve you...
